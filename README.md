ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Riyans!

ðŸŽ“ I'm a student at Shri Shankaracharya Technical Campus, deeply passionate about coding, data science, and artificial intelligence. Over the years, I've honed my skills in Python, C programming, SQL and various machine learning techniques.

ðŸ”§ I love working on hands-on projects that turn ideas into reality. Whether it's building voice recognition chatbots or exploring AI-powered solutions, I'm always excited to push the boundaries of technology. I'm also particularly interested in the fields of gesture recognition and sign language translation.

ðŸ’¡ My goal is to keep learning and contributing to innovative projects, whether it's through hackathons or developing practical tools that address real-world challenges. I'm thrilled to share my journey and projects here on GitHub!
